{QUESTION}

2. Write a Python function to produce the outputs such as:
(a) 	 1
	21
 	321
	4321


5. Write a program that reads an integer value and prints “leap year” or “not a leap
year”


6. Write a menu driven program to calculate the area of given building. Accept
suitable inputs and use suitable assertions.


7. Write a Python function that takes a number as an input from the user and
computes its factorial.


8. Write a Python function to generate the Fibonacci sequence till a given number
“n”.


9. Write a function that takes a number as an input and finds its reverse and
computes the sum of its digits.


10. Write a function that takes two numbers as input parameters and returns their
least common multiple.


11. Write a function that takes a number as an input and determine whether it is
prime or not.


12. Write a function that finds the sum of the
a) first nth odd terms
b) first nth even terms


13. Write a Python function that takes a string as an input from the user and
determines whether it is palindrome or not.


14. Write a function that takes a sentence as input from the user and calculates the
frequency of each letter. Use a variable of dictionary type to maintain the count.


15. Write a Python function that prints a dictionary where the keys are numbers
between 1 and 5 and the values are cubes of the keys.


16. Consider a tuple t1=(1,2,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,10). Write a program to perform following
operations:
a. Print half the values of tuple in one line and the other half in the next line.
b. Print another tuple whose values are even numbers in the given tuple.
c. Concatenate a tuple t2=(11,13,15) witht1.
d. Return maximum and minimum value from this tuple.


17. Write a function called “check_duplicates” that takes a list and returns true if
there is any element that appears more than once. Also find the frequency of that
element. The original list should not be modified.


19. Write a menu driven program to perform the following functions on strings:
a. Find the length of string
b. Return maximum of three strings
c. Accept a string and replace every successive character with ‘#’ ExampleFor Given string ‘Hello World’ returned string is ‘H#l#o W#r#d’.
d. Find number of words in the given string


20. Write a Python program to perform the following using list:
a. Check if all elements in list are numbers or not
b. If it is a numeric list, then count number of odd values in it
c. If list contains all Strings, then display largest String in the list
d. Display list in reverse form
e. Find a specified element in list
f. Remove the specified element
